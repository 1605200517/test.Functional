# test.Functional.API.test

Repository API.test contains the automatic scripts and commands to execute functional API tests for each Generic Enables.
The xml files have been produced using tool soapUI 4.5.1 SMARTBEAR.
Each file xml is a soapUI project that can be imported into soapUI and easily analyzed and executed.
Each soupUI project contains the set of functional tests related to a specific Generic Enabler.
The basic condition is that each component is successfully installed according to the guidelines reported into the 
Installation and Administration guides. 
The Generic Enabler documentation is available on the FIWARE catalogue http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers in section dedicated to the documentation of each specific component.
The REST request endpoints configured into the soupUI project file contain the IP address of the host where the tests have been performed.
